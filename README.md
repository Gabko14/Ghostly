# Ghostly

**The notepad that appears when you need it and vanishes when you don't.**

You're in the zone. An idea hits. You need to write it down *now* — not after launching an app, finding a file, or waiting for sync.

Hit your shortcut. Ghostly appears. Type. Hit the shortcut again. Gone.

Your thought is saved. Your flow is intact.

No projects. No folders. No formatting. No friction.

Just you and a blank page, one keystroke away.
